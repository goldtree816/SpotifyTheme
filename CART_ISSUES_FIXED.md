# Cart Model Issues Fixed

## Issues Identified and Resolved

### 1. **JavaScript Event Listener Duplication**
**Problem**: The cart drawer was attaching event listeners multiple times, causing memory leaks and potential conflicts.

**Solution**: 
- Added `eventListenersAttached` flag to prevent duplicate event listener attachment
- Reset the flag when content is reloaded
- Improved event listener management

### 2. **Poor Error Handling**
**Problem**: Cart operations lacked proper error handling, making debugging difficult and providing poor user experience.

**Solution**:
- Added comprehensive try-catch blocks with proper error messages
- Implemented user-friendly error notifications
- Added HTTP status code checking
- Created `showCartMessage()` function for consistent error display

### 3. **CSS Conflicts**
**Problem**: Duplicate cart drawer styles in `product.css` were conflicting with `cart-drawer.css`.

**Solution**:
- Removed duplicate cart drawer styles from `product.css`
- Kept only the main cart drawer styles in `cart-drawer.css`
- Added comment explaining the removal

### 4. **Race Conditions**
**Problem**: Cart operations could have timing issues between cart updates and UI updates.

**Solution**:
- Converted all cart operations to async/await
- Added proper sequencing of operations
- Added small delays where needed for cart synchronization

### 5. **Inconsistent Cart Count Updates**
**Problem**: Cart count badge updates were inconsistent across different pages and operations.

**Solution**:
- Standardized cart count update function
- Made cart count updates async with proper error handling
- Ensured cart count updates happen after all cart operations

### 6. **Accessibility Issues**
**Problem**: Cart drawer lacked proper focus management and keyboard navigation.

**Solution**:
- Added focus styles for all interactive elements
- Improved button sizing for better touch targets
- Added proper ARIA attributes support

### 7. **Image Error Handling**
**Problem**: Missing product images could break the cart drawer layout.

**Solution**:
- Added fallback image handling with `onerror` attributes
- Added background styling for missing images
- Improved image container styling

### 8. **Mobile Responsiveness**
**Problem**: Cart drawer wasn't fully optimized for mobile devices.

**Solution**:
- Added comprehensive mobile media queries
- Improved touch targets and spacing
- Better responsive layout for small screens

### 9. **Loading States**
**Problem**: Users had no feedback during cart operations.

**Solution**:
- Added proper loading states for add-to-cart buttons
- Improved visual feedback during operations
- Better state management for button text changes

### 10. **Network Error Handling**
**Problem**: Network failures weren't handled gracefully.

**Solution**:
- Added proper fetch error handling
- Implemented retry logic where appropriate
- Better error messages for different failure types
